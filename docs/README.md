   - You can open the project directly if you see it listed under recent files or by navigating to **File > Open Folder** and selecting the cloned repository folder.

3. **Install Node.js**
   - Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
   - Download and install the latest version from [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4. **Install Docusaurus**

     ```

5. **Run the Program**
