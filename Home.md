# Welcome to the ACSL Flight Stack Wiki

Welcome to the documentation for the ACSL Flight Stackâ€”a control-oriented flight stack for autonomous multi-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) developed by the Advanced Control Systems Lab (ACSL).

This stack is PX4-compatible and designed for research and deployment on UAVs such as quadcopters and X8-copters. It hosts both classical and advanced control systems, including Feedback Linearization, PID, and Robust MRAC.

**Explore the wiki pages to get started, install the stack, review scientific references, and see the chronology of experimental UAV flights.**
